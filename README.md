Problem Statement

The healthcare system in Germany is facing challenges in efficiently and accurately diagnosing pulmonary diseases, particularly in distinguishing between COVID-19, viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, and healthy cases based on X-ray images.

The current manual process of interpreting X-ray images is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to human error, leading to delays in diagnosis and potential misdiagnoses.

Company Background:

Our company, Smart Inc. is a healthcare technology startup that aims to revolutionize the detection and diagnosis of Pulmonary Diseses.

We believe that the use of advanced machine learning techniques can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of its classification, which will ultimately save lives and reduce healthcare costs.

Objectives

Reduce misdiagnoses and ensure patients receive the appropriate treatment by accurately classifying X-ray images

Reduce the time and effort required by radiologists and healthcare professionals in diagnosis by automating the process of analyzing X-ray images

Ensure that the developed deep learning model is scalable and can generalize well to new, unseen X-ray images.

Seamlessly integrate the deep learning model into the hospital's existing electronic health record (EHR) and radiology workflows to optimise the diagnostic process and facilitate data exchange.

METHODLOGY

Collect and organize the dataset of 133 images into separate folders for
each class: COVID-19, Normal, Viral Pneumoni, and Bacterial Pneumonia.

Represent the dataset using appropriate data structures

Explore the dataset to understand its structure, characteristics, and any inconsistencies.

Identify and extract relevant features from the dataset that can ] effectively represent the different classes

Select the best architecture from 4 different architectures, that can handle the chosen features and classes effectively.

Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics
